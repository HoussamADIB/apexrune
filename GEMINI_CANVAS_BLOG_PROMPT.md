# Gemini Canvas Prompt: Blog Page Design Review & Recommendations

## Context
I'm building a Technical Blog page for ApexRune, a Salesforce consulting company. The page is part of a modern, professional website with a blue and white color scheme. I'd like your expert advice on enhancing the visual design, user experience, and overall quality of this page.

## Current Page Structure

### 1. **Top Navigation Bar**
- ApexRune logo (light blue triangular icon + dark blue text) on the left
- Navigation links: "Home," "What We Do" (dropdown), "Insights" (dropdown), "Contact Us" button (blue)
- Clean, minimal design

### 2. **Blog Page Header Section**
- "INSIGHTS" label in light gray (small, uppercase)
- Main title: "Technical Blog" (large, bold, dark blue - currently 3rem font size)
- Subtitle: "Expert insights on Salesforce optimization, automation, and best practices" (gray text)
- Reduced bottom padding (1.5rem) for better spacing
- Border separator below

### 3. **Featured Article Section**
- Section header: "Featured Article" (1.5rem, bold, dark blue)
- Full-width card with smooth blue gradient background (from #2563EB to #1E40AF to #1E3A8A)
- Content includes:
  - "⭐ FEATURED" badge (white, semi-transparent background) + category tag ("OPTIMIZATION")
  - Large white title: "10 Signs Your Salesforce Org Needs Optimization"
  - White excerpt text
  - Footer with date and read time
- No image placeholder (removed as requested)
- Hover effect: slight lift with shadow

### 4. **All Articles Section**
- Header: "All Articles" (left) + article count "5 articles" (right)
- Grid layout: 3 columns on desktop, responsive to 1 column on mobile
- Each article card:
  - White background, light gray border, rounded corners
  - Gray image placeholder at top
  - Category tag (light blue) + date
  - Title (dark blue, bold)
  - Excerpt (gray, 3-line clamp)
  - Footer: read time + "Read →" link
  - Consistent heights with aligned footers

### 5. **Design Details**
- Container width: 1200px max-width
- Color scheme: Blue (#2563EB, #1E40AF, #1E3A8A) and white
- Typography: Clean sans-serif, good hierarchy
- Spacing: Generous whitespace, well-balanced
- Responsive: Mobile-friendly breakpoints

## Questions & Areas for Improvement

Please provide recommendations on:

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Is the featured article prominent enough? Should there be additional visual distinction?

2. **Typography**: Are font sizes, weights, and spacing optimal? Any suggestions for better readability?

3. **Color & Contrast**: Does the blue gradient work well? Are there accessibility concerns?

4. **Layout & Spacing**: Is the spacing between sections optimal? Should the grid layout be adjusted?

5. **User Experience**: What could make the page more engaging? Should we add filters, search, or category navigation?

6. **Visual Elements**: 
   - Are the article cards visually appealing?
   - Should we add hover states or animations?

7. **Call-to-Action**: Is it clear how users should engage with the content?

8. **Mobile Experience**: Any specific mobile optimization suggestions?

9. **Overall Polish**: What small details could elevate the design quality?
